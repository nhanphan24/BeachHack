Title: LeBron Gets His Rings

LeBron Gets His Rings is a platform game developed through Unity and C#.
The game can be played through the 'HackGame.exe' file in the 'GAME'
folder. The player controls LeBron James and can move forward by presssing 
the right arrow key. The left arrow key moves LeBron James to the left, and 
the space key allows the character to jump. There are basketball being
generated to hit LeBron to stop the player from winning. The goal is to
get as many rings as possible.

This project was developed at a hackathon at CSU Long Beach from 4/20/19 
to 4/21/19.
